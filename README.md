## Spline Wall Tool
A tool used to generate wall sections to entire rooms.
For now the easiest way to try out the tool is to copy the [Blueprint Prototype](UnrealProceduralTools/SplineWallTool/BlueprintPrototype).

A faster, more maintainable [C++ version](UnrealProceduralTools/SplineWallTool/Source) is also available and can be added to your
own project and compiled as usual.
